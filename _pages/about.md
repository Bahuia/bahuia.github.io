I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at [the School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.seu.edu.cn) at [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn). I earned both my PhD and master's degrees in Software Engineering from Southeast University. My undergraduate degree in Internet of Things Engineering was obtained from [Northeastern University](https://www.neu.edu.cn).

I am broadly interested in developing artificial intelligence, specifically focusing on integrating structured or semi-structured knowledge into foundation models like large language models (LLMs) to enhance their performance in question answering and other more complex tasks.
I am also concerned with the continual learning capability of the foundation model, to adapt and evolve over time. This requires mechanisms to update its knowledge base in response to new knowledge, trends, and changes in the environment it operates within.
